The Learn to Code environment has been created to help you decide, if you really want to code as a job. Enjoying time on your computer, solving tehcnical problems, setting up all the tech in your house, doesn't add up to being a coder. It's not for everyone.

Here, you'll find that not all coding is the same. There are areas which you'll enjoy more than others. The Learn to Code environment is there to help you decide if there's a specific side to coding you enjoy.

This is not a deep dive into coding. It's very suface level. I will provide pointers to further learning.

This is not a foolproof set of instructions. It's possible, that you'll have problems setting it up on your computer. People who are more suited to coding will enjoy overcoming such obstacles.

It's likely that the code you write will not work first time and that you will get frustrated. This is normal. It cantwarealso be treated as part of the learning process in finding out if you enjoy coding.

If have divided the learning into 4 areas:
 1. [Installation of the Environment](./SOFTWARE-INSTALLATION.md).
 2. Understanding the back-end.
 3. Understanding the middleware and APIs.
 3. Understanding the front end.

Many developers would find issues with this approach. That's to be expected. There should be room for all sorts of opinion in this world. We shouldn't take this badly, but this is one of a number of perfectly credible approaches. You'll just have to decide for yourself if it's the one for you.
