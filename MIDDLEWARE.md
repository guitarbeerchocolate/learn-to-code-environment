# Middleware/API
There are 2 areas you need to understand to be a Middleware/API developer:

 1. Coding basics
 2. API basics

I'm not going to teach you how to do either of the features within the areas above. We all have different learning styles, and we respond to different teachers. Within this document however, I will tell you what you will need to know, so that you can go off and learn them your way. I would encourage you to complete your learning here to fully appreciate if this is something you may enjoy.

The Learn to Code environment has been setup to allow you to create middleware/API code in the PHP language.

I find this tutorial to be very good https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp

## Coding Basics
 1. Sequence (doing things in a particular order).
 2. Selection (doing things based on criteria).
 3. Interation (doing things until a criteria has been reached).
 4. Object Orientated Programming (OOP) (establishing classes).
 5. Model View Controller (MVC) (dividing code between backend, middleware and frontend). Sound familiar?
 6. Frameworks and libraries (using code, and methods of working created by others). Examples of thes would be:
  * [PEAR](https://pear.php.net/)
  * [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is a good one, but there are many others.

## API Basics
 1. Calling APIs.
 2. RESTful APIs.
 3. Creating your own APIs.
## Aditionally
### Coding Standards
Try and use good coding standards. An example of this would lie in [PEAR](https://pear.php.net/manual/en/pear2cs.php). They help when working with others.
### Source Control
As early as you feel comfortable, learn [Git](https://git-scm.com/). It will help you in so many ways, including going back to a previous stage when you've messed up, documenting how you got to where you are, separating the projects into smaller parts, and working with others.

I find this tutorial to be very good https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp
### Libraries
You can make use of code already written by other developers. These are easily obtained through package managers such is [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Such tools manage all the dependancies and versions of the libraries to install.
