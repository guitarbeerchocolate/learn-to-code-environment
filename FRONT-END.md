# Frontend
There are 3 main areas to understand to be a frontent developer:

 1. HTML.
 2. CSS.
 3. JavaScript.
 4. Frameworks.

I'm not going to teach you how to do either of the features within the areas above. We all have different learning styles, and we respond to different teachers. Within this document however, I will tell you what you will need to know, so that you can go off and learn them your way. I would encourage you to complete your learning here to fully appreciate if this is something you may enjoy.

## HTML
A common mistake made by first time coders of HTML is to try and get it to style the page. Avoid the temptation to do this. Leave this to CSS.

I would also encourage you to learn any techniques in your IDE to speed up the coding of HTML. Many IDEs offer access to [Emmet](https://emmet.io/) either as part of the installation or by extension.

Avoid adding in-line CSS and JavaScript.

I find this tutorial to be very good https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp

Another thing which HTML can help with, is Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). As you become better at coding HTML, bear this in mind.

Finally, there are standards out there for creating HTML. One example would be [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/). They become more useful when working with others, and help you to think about the structure of your HTML.
## CSS
It's important to learn the fundamentals of CSS before progressing to additional techniques in styling the pages.

I find this tutorial to be very good https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

Once learned there are a few of additional techniques which are worth improving your abilities on, beginning with:

 1. CSS Grid.
 2. A mobile first approach through media queries.
 3. Sass, a CSS pre-processor.

## JavaScript
It's important to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript before progressing to additional techniques in controlling the interaction within pages.

I find this tutorial to be very good https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp

Once you have learned these basics, you can make use of code already written by other developers through for example [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Such tools manage all the dependancies and versions of the libraries to install.

I find this tutorial to be very good https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_intro.asp

You can also find great benefit in adopting a JavaScript framework. Examples of these would be:
 * [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
 * [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).
 * [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/).
## Frameworks
On top of HTML, CSS and JavaScript frameworks, there are some created to provide a starting point for any web page project. Basically your website can look and behave well before you've even written a line of code. Examples include:
 * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
 * [Foundation](https://get.foundation/).
 * [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI).
